# RomanistHere (me) personal website

Well-structured description of my profession-related activities - whether it be side projects, technologies I prefer or companies I worked at. [Have a look](https://romanisthere.dev/md/about-me).

## Tech

I built it with SvelteKit + Tailwind because they're the best. No TypeScript since there is no adequate reasons to use it for this kind of project. Left a room for testing when I have nothing else to do (unlikely).

Site is hosted on Cloudflare and works perfectly with JS disabled, though enabling it will make transitions smoother.
