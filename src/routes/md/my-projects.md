I'll list them in order I made them.

- **PopUpOFF** - [browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/popupoff-popup-and-overla/ifnkdbpmgkdbfklnbfidaackdenlmhgh) that _removes any popups_ and other naughty stuff from the screen. While it might not have the fanciest "best code practices" - I've done it in plain JS years ago - it's the _most successful app of mine and has more than 250K installs with 4.8/5 rating by now_. Open source, free, no ads, no tracking.
- **Stylify** - browser extension too, the idea was to make ugly websites more readable. It was all right but then there was browser _native "read" mode, which destroyed the purpose for my app to exist_. Now it's remembered only in rare old tales from the East and [this archived repository](https://github.com/RomanistHere/StyLIFy).
- **YouTube PLAS** (PLAylist Search) - guess what, an extension again - yeah I was fond of them and was solving problems I saw on the web regularly. This one was adding _functionality to search through "liked" videos_ right within the YouTube interface. It was working flawlessly, but then YouTube changed a lot of stuff: "likes" were not public anymore and right now not even tales will remember it. [This website might](https://romanisthere.github.io/YouTube-PLAS-Website/)
- **MarkALink** - [yep, extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markalink/jgfjphpcldeifiifdmjpjoidkdhbcboe). the 2nd most useful one. You can _mark links you don't want to visit again_. Very helpful if you're monitoring websites in search of something every day and by the 10th day you're not sure by a picture if you've opened the listing previously or not. Check [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY6F0NffauI). I was so enthusiastic about cyber punk then, that I've made a whole website in that style, _submitted it to [awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/sites/markalink) and got some nice reviews_. But I never did any marketing for that, so while it still is on, users are not many.
- Finally, not an extension: **Measureland** - the project I fell in love with SvelteKit. Measureland is a service with huge ambitions which MVP I [released locally](https://github.com/RomanistHere/Measureland) where I lived at that time. It got a lot of attention and positive feedback. Also it was _the first project I've got a group of volunteers to manage_ and it appeared to be a very hard job, though we were succeeding at that time: online and onsite meetings, hackathons, etc. However I wanted to make it ideal before the release and it was a critical mistake - it is never possible. Our motivation flew away and currently the project is unfinished and on hold. But this one shall have a bright future so I'm looking to return back one day.
- **Melme** is what I am [working on now](https://melme.io/). Very Dubai related at this point project, it's a gift from me to this wonderful city. _Second time I've got volunteers to help, do handle it better_. In fact I handle everything much better compared to the previous project: I still want to do "ideal" before releasing it fully - right now it's like MVP - but I update it regularly, talk with users and follow other practices to not burn myself again and make the product better and my team comfortable.
- **LinkedIn Quick Replies** - [an extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkedin-quick-replies/pfgcpffbebicalfmjajbmacnfopgobom?hl=en-GB&authuser=0) that _adds fast editable replies on your message tab_ sparing some time on copypasting or writing the same questions and answers over and over. It was a part of functionality from my another extension and I've decided to move it to a separate app which was released very recently.

There were a few tools that I have made also but not listed - some of them never went out of beta and right now are barely usable like [**HR helper**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hr-helper/legoehlgnimpdcopbolhlgcfhanhmckh?hl=en-GB&authuser=0) or [**LinkedAdd**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkedadd-add-people-auto/beafgeiopjehkondbenpkhipailboiam?hl=en-GB&authuser=0), some are just to specific and not interesting for most of my readers, like an [**npm module**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/preact-tilt) or [**app for my JavaScript watch**](https://github.com/espruino/BangleApps/pull/1106).
