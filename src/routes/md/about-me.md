description: Short text to get to know Roman better.
---

Professionally, I'm a _web developer_ - I use programming to make money at my job, but also _to solve problems and help people in my spare time_. In the best case scenario I do both at the same time - but even then I don't stop creating helpful tools in the free ~~nights~~ hours. You can check _some things I made by seeing ["Personal projects"](my-projects)_.

But _profession is but a part of my life_. It is big - the biggest one - but there are a bunch of things I'm interested in and curious about apart from it. There are _broad areas of interest I follow_, having got deep into some by this time: _psychology, philosophy, culture and religion_ - but also some more scientific, like you would expect from a programmer: _physics and astrophysics_ - I wanted to be one for a long time, lol.

That all sounds pretty nerdy, doesn't it? It surely does, but actually _I'm an extremely easy-to-connect-with person_ open to chat around. _I like making friends with people I meet outside_, prefer the old way to social networks - that's why you won't find my personal account anywhere, it just doesn't exist.

I care about privacy also, that's why I won't share much more info here, but if you would like to know me better, don't hesitate to [contact](contact-me).
