title: Check professional links
description: Discover more job-related things about Roman.
---

Most of the work I've done for my jobs were closed-source, so even if I gave you my Nord Security GitLab account, you wouldn't be able to check out my awesome React/TypeScript skills there. And I don't think that account exists anymore.

Good news is I do most of my projects open source, so you can check my [personal GitHub](https://github.com/RomanistHere/) as well as some of [my work for NLX](https://github.com/nlxai/voice-compass-sdk/pull/33) - we have our SDKs open-sourced. However I want to warn you, _in my personal projects I don't use much TypeScript or testing (Jest, etc) because - and it's a **critical** thing to understand - I'm not only a developer there, but also a product owner and manager, meaning I have to distribute available resources in a way that leads to releasing proof of concept as soon as possible_, so I get more motivation, more help, more feedback, etc. What that means also is that _I need to sacrifice some of "the best" code practices otherwise the whole project will fail and everything I wrote wouldn't matter..._

This is actually the topic for a separate discussion, but I already wrote too much text, let's spend no more time on that and jump in the links now that you have my warning:

- [Personal GitHub](https://github.com/RomanistHere/) - SvelteKit + Tailwind is my default way to go now, so most projects for the last 2+ years, including [this website](https://github.com/RomanistHere/RomanistHere.dev), use it. Before I actively used Preact and plain JavaScript.
- [NLX GitHub](https://github.com/RomanistNLX) - a lot of projects, but only 2 of them open source and I wasn't the owner. Check pull requests to find my code. A few examples: [[1](https://github.com/nlxai/voice-compass-sdk/pull/33)], [[2](https://github.com/nlxai/voice-compass-sdk/pull/20/files)], [[3](https://github.com/nlxai/voice-compass-sdk/pull/37)], [[4](https://github.com/nlxai/chat-sdk/pull/15)].
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romanist/) - say hi, I always respond.
- [My old website](https://romanisthere.github.io/) - you might find some useful info there as well as a blog with a few interesting thoughts.
