## Experience ~~skills~~
BS in Mathematics. More than 7 years of serious work in production: digital agencies, startups, products – I’ve faced it all. I led small teams to a win as well as carried projects alone. Been part of some cool crews.

You have definitely heard of some companies I worked at, like Nord Security (NordVPN), might have heard about others depending on your location, for example NLX (NYC, US) – where I work now or Altabel (LT).

I do pet projects in my spare time alone and with volunteers including UX/UI design, product management, development, SEO and marketing – some succeeded and some not – so I also know how to fail.

I programmed mobile apps, watches, landing pages, games, browser extensions, TV installations and of course big enterprise apps. Know FP and OOP. But you must be tired to read about me, what about you?
