_Front-end developer_, or as it's popular nowadays - Software Engineer - _with BS in Mathematics_. Since I know JavaScript very well, I am technically a Full Stack - I wrote a lot of back-end code on Node.js - but I prefer to work on front-end.

_I've a feeling of beauty and it's a shame to waste it writing the back-end_ unless required :)

## Hard skills

At my level of experience I understand that _frameworks is but a tool_ to achieve a task. _I learnt Angular, Node, then React and Preact, afterwards Svelte, then Vue and finally Elm_. Lucky for me, my early teachers gave me the understanding that _mastering JavaScript fundamentals would allow me to learn any framework in no time_. That appeared to be true.

If I had a choice, _I'd go with Svelte/SvelteKit_ - I've been using it for more than 2 years - since the very beginning of SvelteKit - and all the positive words you heard about it are true. _Svelte gives a much simpler and lighter way to achieve the same things compared to other tools_. Once you learn how good developer experience can be, it's very hard to turn back to React, for example.

I have also _mastered HTML, CSS, semantics, web security, SEO, cross-browser compatibility and accessibility_ during my path. I know and use both OOP and FP - which stand for _object-oriented and functional programming_ - and am flexible in terms of both.

There are so much things I've learnt and used in past years - I've been _part of more than 40 different projects_ by now - that it would take quite some time for me to remember, list and describe - and what's more important, for you to read - that it would be a very unproductive thing to do, so we won't. I'll just note that I had a _great exposure to visualisation; browser extensions; web, desktop and mobile apps; data structures and algorithms_.

## Soft skills

_Very easy to talk to, a critical thinking and logical person with a high emotional intelligence who’s planning to get an MS in Psychology one day._

Describing soft skills is like describing a picture - sure, you can imagine meanings of the words but you need to see yourself to understand. So I encourage you to try!

## Other experience ~~skills~~

More than _7 years of serious work in production: [digital agencies, startups, products](worked)_ – I’ve faced it all. _I led small teams to a win as well as carried projects alone_. Been part of some cool crews.

_I do [pet projects](../my-projects) in my spare time_ alone and with volunteers including _UX/UI design, product management, development, SEO and marketing_ – some succeeded and some not – so I also know how to fail.

I volunteer myself, for example: [Venus Project](https://www.thevenusproject.com/).

_I programmed mobile apps, watches, landing pages, games, browser extensions, TV installations and of course big enterprise apps_ - but you must be tired to read about me, what about you? [Contact me](contact-me).
