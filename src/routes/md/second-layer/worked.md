title: Where I worked

I've worked at 4 companies so far. It all begun in a small local digital agency and ended up going worldwide. I'll list companies by relevancy - from current to old ones.

## NLX

[Link](https://nlx.ai/our-team). New York based startup where I work remotely right now and the best place I've worked at. I got to work with Svelte, React, Vue and Elm here. Thanks to Peter, I have seriously advanced my skills in Functional Programming. Apart from our own applications: Voice Compass and Dialog Studio - I've done some projects for big clients I can't name and participated in our [open source SDK](https://github.com/nlxai) development as a developer and lead.

## Nord Security (NordVPN, NordPass)

With name that big and famous you don't need a link to find the correct one. I've been working with desktop application and extension -- both written in React. It was a great place to work at - I'm into privacy stuff and when the time came to choose between Nord Security and Yandex I had made a choice I have no regrets about.

## Altabel

[Link](https://altabel.com/). This job gave so much it's hard to imagine who I would be without it. They had office in my city, but I opened a world of remote work with them. I've been part of different projects across Europe, tried and learnt a lot of technologies - it was my first international experience and it felt so great, that till today I can't enjoy that enough. I've been also interviewing a lot as well as leading small teams and communicating with clients.

## H-W-H-P

I can't provide a link here because it exists no more. We were a small digital agency. I was one of the first who worked there and also on of the last. Starting as an intern I've learnt basically everything there. The guys who were teaching me did a great work and they are still but some of my best friends today. I would never be able to express my gratitude to them.

There were hard times when I had to do double and triple work combining it with another non-IT-related job I had had at that time. There were powerful and miserable times, when I had to try out my teaching and leading skills in the first time. There was so much of everything! In any case I consider myself lucky for these guys in my life.

## As a conclusion

It might sound not right that every job was "the best" - but I assure you they were. I rather tend to think that it's wrong if the next job isn't better than the previous one. I understand problems exist and sometimes we are just not in the position to choose what we want, but often we only think that we aren't. Because job is a biggest chunk of life for most of us, we do really need to pick carefully and thoughtfully.
