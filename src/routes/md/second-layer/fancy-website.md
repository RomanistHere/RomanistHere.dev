title: Why I don't have a fancier website

You might have expected a fancy website here - I might have done it, even. Like the other devs do - to bring beauty to this world, learn a new tool and ~~show off~~ impress. I would have loved that, but I don't have time for this, you see. _I spend my personal programming ~~nights~~ hours to actually bring value to other people_. I've been doing pet projects for the last 4-5 years and some of them have even succeeded by this time whereas some of them haven't. You can check them in my ["Personal projects"](../my-projects) section.

As you may notice, there are quite a few projects. _Some of them were a few-weeks-to-month size - others, like Measureland - I spent almost 2 years on. Apart from coding, I also did design, marketing, video directing and editing, promoting, SEO, articles and texts writing, project managing and much more stuff_ - I cannot imagine how much time did it take. Sometimes I'm looking at it and wondering where I even get all that time... But this is a very interesting path. _It's a path of happiness - to feel yourself useful to society (even a little) and hear people [thank you](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/popupoff-popup-and-overla/ifnkdbpmgkdbfklnbfidaackdenlmhgh) sometimes._ Mistakes give lots of information where and how to improve - I believe they lead the path to "success", though I dislike the word in this context - but explaining myself would take another wall of text.

Apart from that I have a job to do and life to live, actually.

I also did this website instead of the [old version](https://romanisthere.github.io/) which I did too. I did the previous one so long ago that Preact didn't have **.jsx** support yet. This "website" and text exist mainly because people tend to judge by "the cover". _I'm not having a fancy website because I enjoy using my software engineering knowledge to actually help people rather than doing meaningless animations on my awesome website or rewriting the same JS-tips-everyone-should-know articles again and again for my blog._
